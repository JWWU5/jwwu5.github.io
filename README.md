### üêº About Me

Hi, I'm Jiayi! 

I'm a UX/UI Developer. I studied Master of Software Engineering in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Melbourne. I'm skilled in creating intuitive and engaging interfaces with Unity, for interactive games and XR applications for healthcare. I also have extensive experience in web and Android development, with a strong passion for designing accessible, user-centred experiences across platforms.

I am innovative and eager to learn more about new tools and technologies. In addition, I am proficient in software requirements gathering, Agile methodologies, and technical documentation. 

I'm looking for positions in UX/UI development for both Unity and web. I'm also open to opportunities in full-stack development, as I'm currently building my skills in this area through self-learning.
